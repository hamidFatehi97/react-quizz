Hey everyone!

i have just started to learn "React" (it's about a month) & i want to share my progression;

so i made a little quiz app emphasised on two "React" principles, the hooks 'useEffect' & 'useReducer'.

i did it based on a udemy "React" course but i have done the whole "React" part step by step myself, and i have a complete grasp of all the code placed there !

the data is placed in a same named folder (data) and is being fetched via fake api.
you can access it by running this command in your terminal : 'npm run server'
(also you need one other terminal to run the app by typing 'npm start')

Hope you guys enjoy it !
